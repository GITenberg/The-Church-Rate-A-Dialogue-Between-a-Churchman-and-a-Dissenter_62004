3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> object of the following
Dialogue is to expose, in familiar language, the absurd arguments
by which political Dissenters attempt to justify their deeds of
hatred against the Established Church, and their union with
Papists and Infidels&mdash;with every wild boar out of the forest
of irreligion and error&mdash;in attempting to root up a vine,
under the shadow of which they have long reposed in security and
peace.</p>
<p>Several persons having expressed their approval of this Tract,
the writer has been led to print this second and enlarged edition
of it for general circulation, omitting those local allusions
which were introduced to make the work more interesting in his
own neighbourhood, and which succeeded in rendering its
circulation extensive among those for whose information it was
first printed.</p>
<p>He trusts that the plain arguments here brought forward, may
tend, in some small degree, to remove unfounded and ignorant
prejudices against the Established Church, believing it, as he
does, to be the bulwark of our national Christianity, and the
fortress of our civil and religious liberties.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>THE
CHURCH RATE.</h2>
<p><i>Mr. Churchman</i>.&mdash;Neighbour Spinwell, what in the
world are you doing?</p>
<p><i>Mr. Spinwell</i>.&mdash;I am beating up for recruits to
attend the Vestry Meeting in defence of Dissenting principles,
and conscientious scruples; and to make a stand against Church
oppression.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;I respect conscientious scruples; but if Dissent
signifies Religion with <i>you</i>, it does not with
<i>me</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;What!&nbsp; Do you mean to say that Dissenters
have no religion?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;No.&nbsp; But I say, that what Dissenters have of
late years gained by their noisy and political strife, they have
more than lost in real piety, and in the esteem of the wise and
good.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;But how many great and good men have been
Dissenters?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Yes,&mdash;men who would not own you.&nbsp; Do
you think that Watts, and Doddridge, and Matthew Henry would have
joined with the noisy, factious Dissenters of our day?&nbsp;
Would they have given &ldquo;the right hand of fellowship&rdquo;
to men, who, in railing against the Church and the State, expose
their own folly and irreligion?</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Be that as it may, I say, that I ought not to
support a Church to which I do not belong.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;And does your saying it make it either law or
gospel?</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I say, that oppression is contrary both to the
Law, and to the Gospel.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;And so say I.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Why, then, do you wonder at my making a stir,
when I am an oppressed and persecuted man?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Many, who pay <i>the least</i>, often complain
<i>the most</i>; and though you feel yourself so grievously
persecuted, I dare say that your Church-rate has never been more
than two or three shillings a-year.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I do not care whether I pay two shillings or two
pence.&nbsp; I say, that I ought not to pay to the Church-rate,
and support a religion to which I do not belong.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Nothing is more common than to hear a Dissenter
say &ldquo;I ought not to pay to a religion to which I do not
belong.&rdquo;&nbsp; It sounds very plausible, but there is no
truth in it.&nbsp; The fact <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>is, that you do not pay the
Church-rate as a Dissenter, nor do I as a Churchman.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;How do you make that out?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Ages ago, and long before there was a Dissenter
in this or any other town in England, the property we occupy was
made liable to the various expenses of the Church; and the annual
charge is on the property we occupy, and has therefore nothing to
do with the religious opinions of those who occupy it.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I should very much like to know, when
Church-rates began?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;And so should I; but this tribute has been paid
to the Church from such an early period, that no one can tell
when it began.&nbsp; All I can tell you, is this, that the first
record we have of its being levied, is in the reign of Edward
III., more than five hundred years ago. <a
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a></p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;If the payment is so ancient, and a charge on the
property we occupy; having, therefore, nothing to do with the
religious opinions of those who occupy it, how is it, then, that
so many persons are opposed to the Church-rate?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Men of hasty spirits&mdash;little
knowledge&mdash;and less judgment&mdash;are too often led away by
those who ought to teach them better.&nbsp; Your teachers know,
as well as I do, that the Church-rate being charged on the
property, the payment of it can affect no religious
principle.&nbsp; As I said before, &ldquo;it has nothing to do
with either your religion or mine;&rdquo; and if the
churchwardens, in days like the present, had to stop and inquire
at every door, before they knocked, what is this man&rsquo;s
religion?&mdash;or, has he any at all?&mdash;they need have
nothing else to do.&nbsp; Nor is that all; a Protestant Church
would be turned into a Popish Inquisition, and churchwardens into
inquisitors!</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;But, Mr. Churchman, how should you like to be
compelled to pay a rate every year to our Meeting?&nbsp; You
could not pay to it as a Dissenter, and you would not like to pay
to it as a Churchman.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;If a law should be passed to-morrow, charging my
house in common with those of my neighbours, with the repair,
&amp;c., of your meeting, I should pay the charge, I hope, as a
Christian, submitting &ldquo;to every ordinance of man for the
Lord&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; (1 Peter, i. 13).</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;But would it not be an act of oppression to levy
an annual payment on property, which had always before been
bought or rented free from such a charge?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Though I could not but regard it as very
different to a Church-rate, which has existed from time
immemorial, and subject to which all property is purchased or
rented; and though I might also consider it unreasonable to pay
to one sect of Dissenters <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>rather than another; yet, I hope I
should be one of the last men in the world to resist a charge
made by the law of the land, though made unjustly, &ldquo;For
this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure
grief, suffering wrongfully&rdquo; (1 Pet. ii. 19).</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Perhaps such conduct might be a proof of the
sincerity of your Christian principles, though I can hardly admit
that it would.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;If it be a part of true religion to tread as far
as we can in the steps of our Divine Redeemer, I would ask, has
he not, in this very particular, set us an example which it is
our duty to follow?</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;In whatever Christ has set us an example, I admit
that we should follow his steps; but I do not remember the
instance to which you allude.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Do you not recollect that our Saviour, though he
had proved that he and his disciples were &ldquo;free&rdquo; from
paying the tribute, the Church-rate <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a> demanded for the
support of the Jewish temple, yet wrought a miracle for the
payment of it, lest they should offend by refusing it? (Matt.
xvii. 24, 27).</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;What reason have you for calling the tribute paid
by our Saviour, the Church-rate?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Because, &ldquo;the tribute demanded was not any
civil payment to the Roman powers&mdash;that was strictly exacted
by the publicans; but the Church dues, the half-shekel, about
fifteen pence, which was required of <i>every</i> person for the
service of the temple, and the defraying of the expenses of the
worship there: and which our Lord paid, notwithstanding his
&lsquo;Father&rsquo;s house was become a house of merchandize,
and a den of thieves.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>M. Henry</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I own, that if an ancient and annual charge on
property was to change with the religious opinions, first of one
occupier, and then of another, there would be great confusion,
and every rogue would cry out &ldquo;I am a
Dissenter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, still, I think, that some respect
should be shown to the principle of Dissent.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;I hardly know what you mean by the principle of
Dissent.&nbsp; It was said, not long since in the House of
Commons, that &ldquo;Dissenters have always their Dissenting
principles, and their conscientious scruples when they have money
to pay, but none when they have money to receive.&rdquo; <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a></p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Do you mean to insult me by casting such
reflections on the Dissenting body?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Certainly not.&nbsp; You and I are not going to
quarrel after having known each other for more than five
and-twenty years.</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Mr.
S.&mdash;I belong to a body of consistent, conscientious
Dissenters; and you can say nothing against them.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Do not boast too soon.&nbsp; There are Dissenters
here and elsewhere who call the Church-rate &ldquo;a dead
robbery,&rdquo; &ldquo;a scandalous imposition,&rdquo; &ldquo;a
vile extortion;&rdquo; and yet when there is work to be done at
the church, these men, so conscientious&mdash;so scrupulous as to
where the money is to come from&mdash;are the first to send in
their estimates to the churchwardens.&nbsp; And what would they
care if our Church-rate was raised from fivepence to five
shillings in the pound?&nbsp; We know they have a deal to say
when they have little or nothing to pay, but when there is money
to be received, which has been raised by a Church-rate, then
their Dissenting principles, and their conscientious scruples are
lighter than a feather.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I confess that I cannot defend such persons, for
I like consistency.&nbsp; But to turn our conversation to another
subject.&nbsp; I am quite prepared to maintain the excellence of
the Voluntary principle.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;I know you Dissenters like to talk about the
Voluntary principle.&nbsp; They are two very fine long words, the
use of which is often flattering to the vanity of ignorant
persons.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;And pray, what have you to say against the
Voluntary principle?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;I do not wish to say much against it; but I have
yet a good deal to say against the inconsistency of your
practice, so directly opposed as it is to your fine speeches and
avowed principles: for I suppose you must have heard or read
something about the Regium Donum.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Regum Docum!&nbsp; What is that?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;I did not say Regum Docum, that is your Latin,
not mine.&nbsp; I said Regium Donum, which means the royal
bounty.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I am glad that we Dissenters have nothing to do
with money from the State.&nbsp; For &ldquo;that is a poor
religion which cannot support itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;If so, I think I shall prove that your&rsquo;s is
a poor religion.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;But what I say, is, this Regum
Dose&rsquo;em?&nbsp; Is it a sort of physic?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;It is one of the cordials of Dissent, in the
shape of an annual grant from the State.&nbsp; It is a
Parliamentary grant to the three denominations of Dissenters of
about two thousand pounds a year out of the public taxes.&nbsp;
Not a twentieth part of the sum is collected from Dissenters, and
yet the whole finds its way into the pockets of those, who, if
they acted according to their professed Voluntary principle, and
conscientious scruples, would honestly refuse it.&nbsp; So that
the Voluntary principle seems to be one thing, and Dissenting
consistency another.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Do you know when this grant begun?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;It was first given in the reign of George I., as
an act of his royal bounty.&nbsp; But ever since the year 1803,
it has been <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>received from the State&mdash;and it is a fact
acknowledged by Dissenters themselves, that while they are
protesting against all <span class="GutSmall">STATE</span> grants
for religious purposes, <span class="GutSmall">TEN THOUSAND AND
SEVENTY OF THEIR OWN MINISTERS</span> in England and Wales have
participated in these grants in three years.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I really wonder how our great and good men can
conscientiously pocket money from the State; and I am surprised
that none of them have had the honesty to refuse it, and resolve
to stand or fall on the Voluntary principle.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;To tell you the truth, it has been objected to;
and in the year 1834, at a meeting of the three denominations, a
vote was passed disapproving of the grant from the State, as
inconsistent with Dissent, and contrary to the Voluntary
principle.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Well done!</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;It was well said, but there was nothing well
done.&nbsp; There was a great deal of fine talking, which all
ended in nothing, except the disgrace of continuing to pocket
money, after having recorded, &ldquo;that it is inconsistent with
the principles of Dissent, and contrary to the Voluntary
principle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Well, after all, it is but a trifle!</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;I did not know that we were talking about
trifles.&nbsp; But it seems you can sell your Dissenting
principles for a trifle, and give your conscientious scruples
into the bargain.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;There may appear to be some difficulty in
reconciling <i>the practice</i> of receiving money from the State
with <i>the theory</i> of the Voluntary principle.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Do you not see, then, that if Dissenters can
receive from the State two thousand pounds a year, <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> they might just as consistently receive
two millions; and do you not believe, too, that they would, if
they could get them?&mdash;Like the Voluntary principle, I begin
to think that the Church-rate is a subject upon which you have
been sadly misled.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I had always been led to consider the payment of
Church-rates as affecting my religious opinions; whereas, I now
see that it is not so; and as for the Voluntary principle, really
it seems to be, like our independence of the State, all a
farce.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;That is my opinion.&nbsp; Besides your dependence
upon the State, for money, protection, and liberty of conscience,
your <i>Independent</i> Ministers are dependent on their
congregations; and it is well known that they prefer a certainty
to an uncertainty, and never refuse, from conscientious scruples,
a good legacy, or any other sort of endowment which they can
get.&nbsp; Indeed, when it is convenient.&nbsp; Dissenting
Ministers can plead the uncertainty of the Voluntary principle,
with all the eloquence which experience teaches.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I have long suspected that you had but little
respect for Dissent, and now I find that you have none at
all.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Mr.
C.&mdash;I think I have pretty clearly shown that none is due to
it.&nbsp; If, however, any proof be required, look at Dissenters
walking arm in arm with Papists to the political meeting, or the
parish vestry.&nbsp; Look at Protestant Dissenters hugging
Popery, that old Demon of idolatry, superstition, and
wickedness&mdash;that monster of tyranny and oppression, which
their forefathers utterly abhorred.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I was for years a soldier in Spain, where Popery
only tolerates her own idolatrous worship, not merely of images,
wafers, and saints, but also those precious relics of
superstition, old bones and rotten rags! and as I know what
Popery is where she <span class="GutSmall">CAN</span> exercise
her tyranny, and that all her professions of liberalism are
nothing but &ldquo;lies spoken in hypocrisy,&rdquo; I must
acknowledge that by joining such a companion Dissent degrades
herself in the respect and the esteem of all good men.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Then I have a question to ask you.&nbsp; If, when
you were beating up for recruits, the Papists had joined in your
opposition to a Protestant Church, pray how did you mean to act
with your new allies?</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I meant that they <i>should</i> march
<i>behind</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;But suppose they <i>would</i> march
<i>before</i>, you could find but one way of getting out of your
difficulty, and that is, by walking arm in arm together.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;It is not unlikely but I might have found myself
in some difficulty; and so, to say no more about it, I will just
remark, that notwithstanding some proof of our connexion with the
State, I still think the Bible requires that the State should
have nothing to do with religion.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;I know it to be the argument of <i>modern</i>
Dissenters, that &ldquo;Kings&rdquo; are not to be the
&ldquo;nursing fathers,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;Queens the nursing
mothers&rdquo; of the Church; but they learnt that, not from the
Bible, but from the authors of the French Revolution.&nbsp; We
know that Owen, Baxter, Henry, Watts, and Doddridge, and many
other pious Dissenters of former days, have maintained the direct
contrary&mdash;they not only held the lawfulness, but they knew
something of the value, yea of the absolute necessity of an
established Church.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it comes to this (says Dr.
Owen to the rulers of his day), that you shall say, you have
nothing to do with religion as rulers of the nation, God will
quickly manifest that he hath nothing to do with you as rulers of
the nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The State (says Baxter) cannot
stand secure without the Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us (says
Matthew Henry) give God praise for the national establishment of
our religion; that Christianity, purified by the Reformation, is
supported by good and wholesome laws, and is twisted in with the
very constitution of our country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he writes,
&ldquo;<i>It is the duty of rulers to take care of religion</i>,
and to see that the duties of it be regularly and carefully
performed by those under their charge, <i>and that nothing be
wanting that is requisite thereto</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And how can
this be done without a national Church, which is responsible <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to the nation
for that regular observance of public worship to which your
meeting-houses are not?</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;But, why will you not show respect to the opinion
of <i>modern</i> Dissenters&mdash;our ministers of the
<i>present</i> day?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;When your anti-corn law divines shall bear
comparison with the pious and learned men I have named, men who
&ldquo;lived in all godly quietness,&rdquo; it will <i>then</i>
be time enough for me to consider <i>their</i> objections and
<i>yours</i> too.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Notwithstanding, your great names, and your great
men, I rest upon those striking words of our Saviour, &ldquo;my
kingdom is not of this world.&rdquo;&mdash;John xviii. 30.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Pray how do you apply them?</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I apply them to the Church as being &ldquo;of
this world,&rdquo; and to Dissent as being not &ldquo;of this
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;And pray, what right have you to sit in judgment,
and apply in condemnation of the Church, and in commendation of
Dissent, words which have no application to either?</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I maintain that this text does apply to the
subject in hand.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;It is easily proved that it does not.&nbsp; An
accusation was brought against our Saviour, &ldquo;We found this
fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to
C&aelig;sar, saying that he himself is Christ, a
king.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our Lord did not deny that he was a king, but
said, that his kingdom was not of this world&mdash;that it was
not an earthly sovereignty.&nbsp; &ldquo;If my kingdom were of
this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be
delivered to the Jews.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But now (as you may
see by my servants not fighting), is my kingdom not from
hence,&rdquo; that is &ldquo;not of this world.&rdquo;&mdash;John
xviii. 33, 36.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;Well, admitting that you are right, and that my
view of the text is just as ignorant as it is common among
Dissenters, would you not consent to abolish the Church-rate on
account of the opposition that is made to it?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Most certainly not.&nbsp; If on that principle
the Church-rate is abolished, on the same <i>convenient</i>
principle, you might abolish every other kind of rate, and at
last refuse to pay to the State, as well as the Church.</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;I should now like to hear what you have to say
against an annual subscription, as the best way of raising the
money wanted for your Church.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;It <i>might</i> do pretty well if your Voluntary
principle could be relied on.&nbsp; But how can <i>we</i> rely on
that which you are afraid to trust?&mdash;Nothing is more certain
than the uncertainty of an annual subscription; and if our old
churches were made to depend on annual subscriptions to keep them
up, my opinion is, they would soon fall into decay, and this I
suspect is the opinion too of you Dissenters.&nbsp; Many of your
Dissenting meeting-houses have been sold, and not a few of them
have been converted into churches;&mdash;and why?&nbsp; Because
they could not stand on their own Voluntary principle.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Mr.
S.&mdash;Really, I feel as if you had knocked me and the
Voluntary principle both down together.&nbsp; But have you any
other objections to an annual subscription besides its
uncertainty?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Yes, annual subscriptions generally fall
exclusively upon those benevolent persons who give to everything;
whereas the Church-rate obliges those selfish persons to bear
their part who would not, if they could help it, do anything for
the bodies or souls of their fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>Mr. S&mdash;Then, you would have no annual subscriptions?</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;That is not my meaning.&nbsp; Sunday School, and
Religious Societies may be properly supported by annual
subscriptions, or congregational collections; and what Christian
would like to miss such appeals to his charity?</p>
<p>Mr. S.&mdash;To tell you the truth, I begin to think that
there is some wisdom in not allowing your venerable old churches
to depend on the Voluntary principle; and that there is no great
objection to raise money for the necessary expenses of the Church
by a rate, which divides the burden among so many, according to
the property of each, that it is hardly felt by any.&nbsp; Those
who, like our Squire and other great men, pay the most, feel it
perhaps the least.&nbsp; Really, my scruples have almost
vanished; I fear they had but little foundation in religion,
reason, or common sense; and I shall go again to my wheel, and
let my neighbours see, for the time to come, that I have too much
good sense to be again made the tool of a party.</p>
<p>Mr. C.&mdash;Mr. Spinwell, <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a> let me speak one
word to you before we part.&nbsp; Days and weeks, months and
years, like your wheel, go round and round, with wonderful
rapidity, but with this difference, that you can stop your wheel,
whilst neither of us can stay the progress of time.&nbsp; The
thread of life is far spun both with you and me.&nbsp; Let me
then advise you to leave the noisy &ldquo;potsherds of the
earth&rdquo; to &ldquo;strive together,&rdquo; how they may most
effectually resist the payment of a few shillings a year, in
support of a Church, which the wisest and best of men have
maintained to be so necessary to our national
welfare.&mdash;Considering how the world is passing away with all
its transient concerns, let us pray for grace and strength to
&ldquo;press towards the mark for the prize of our high calling
of God in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; that so we may meet at last in the
paradise of God, there to dwell in perfect love and everlasting
peace.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
